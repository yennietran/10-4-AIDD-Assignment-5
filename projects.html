          <p>
            In the summer of 2025, I participated in a required Jumpstart Program designed to equip students with 
            essential skills for the upcoming MSIS fall semester. During this program, I built my first website from 
            the ground up using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project, titled FCRE (Four Circles Racing Events), 
            is a mock company that provides a Formula 1–style driving experience for group events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website consists of seven pages — Home, About Us, Events, Specials, Logistics Approval, Participant
             Survey, and New Event. Through this project (naming a few), I learned how to structure and style content
            using containers, design a responsive navigation bar, embed links, insert images, and build tables to display 
            information effectively. Overall, this experience taught me the fundamentals of front-end development and 
            how to create a simple, functional, and client-ready website from scratch.

          <p>
            During the fall semester of the MSIS program, I took an AI course where we learned how to 
            design and develop chatbots. Using Dialogflow, my team and I created a chatbot named Bob that
             helps users find the most suitable iPhone based on their preferences. The chatbot asks a series 
             of questions about key criteria such as phone size (small, medium, or large), storage capacity 
             (256 GB, 512 GB, or 1 TB), and the number of cameras (2 or 3).
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the user’s responses, Bob recommends an iPhone model currently available on the market.
             Each recommendation includes the iPhone version, a breakdown of the requested specifications, and 
             the price. The chatbot also features built-in fallback responses to handle unclear input 
             gracefully and can restart the conversation if the user wants to search for another device.
             There are a lot of options, so feel free to play around with it!
